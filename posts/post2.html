      </blockquote>
      <p>Success is often measured in money, fame, or power. But at its core, real success—meaningful, lasting success—is about being useful. It's about creating value for others, whether in business, investing, or everyday life. The people who truly make an impact aren't just those who chase personal gain; they're the ones who build, teach, and contribute in ways that make life better for others.</p>
      <p>In my own journey, I've found that one of the most fulfilling ways to spend time is helping others understand investing. Whether through research, discussions, or writing, my goal is to demystify financial markets and help people make better decisions for their future. Investing isn't just about maximizing returns—it's about long-term financial security, independence, and peace of mind. And if I can help even a few people navigate that path more effectively, then that's real value creation.</p>
      <h3 style="color:#888; margin-top:2.5rem;">Why Being Useful Matters</h3>
      <p>Being useful is a simple yet profound idea. It shifts the focus from what we can get to what we can give. And when we provide something of value—knowledge, service, innovation, or even a helping hand—it tends to come back to us in ways we don't always expect.</p>
      <p>Think about some of the most successful businesses and people in the world. Warren Buffett didn't become a legendary investor by hoarding secrets; he wrote, taught, and shared his philosophy so that generations could learn from him. Elon Musk didn't build Tesla, SpaceX, or Neuralink just to make money—his core vision was to solve big problems and advance humanity. Even companies that achieve massive financial success do so by creating something genuinely useful, whether it's an iPhone, Google search, or a simple, well-run restaurant.</p>
      <p>This principle applies at every level. Whether you're a teacher, engineer, artist, or investor, the question isn't just "How do I succeed?" but "How can I create value?"</p>
      <h3 style="color:#888; margin-top:2.5rem;">The Role of Usefulness in Investing</h3>
      <p>In the world of finance, usefulness is often overlooked. Too many investment discussions focus on beating the market, chasing short-term gains, or taking risky bets. But real investing—the kind that stands the test of time—is ultimately about creating value.</p>
      <p>For example, great companies are built by solving real-world problems. If you look at businesses that have endured for decades, they aren't just about making money; they're about making life better. Apple revolutionised personal computing. Amazon transformed shopping and logistics. These companies succeeded because they provided something people genuinely needed.</p>
      <p>As an investor, my role isn't just to find the next hot stock—it's to understand businesses, evaluate their long-term potential, and support companies that are actually improving the world in some way. Investing with a value-driven mindset isn't just good for returns; it aligns money with purpose.</p>
      <p>On a personal level, I see the greatest usefulness in helping others make better financial decisions. Investing can be intimidating, and many people either avoid it entirely or make costly mistakes. If I can simplify complex concepts, challenge common misconceptions, and provide clear guidance, then I'm doing more than just managing numbers—I'm making a real difference in people's financial futures.</p>
      <h3 style="color:#888; margin-top:2.5rem;">The Contrarian Fool Approach to Being Useful</h3>
      <p>A lot of people want quick answers. In investing, they want to know what stock to buy today. In life, they want the shortcut to success. But truly being useful means taking a different approach—one rooted in patience, long-term thinking, and honest effort.</p>
      <p>One of my favorite investing principles is that sometimes, doing nothing is the wisest action. In a world that rewards constant activity, knowing when to wait, when to ignore the noise, and when to focus on fundamentals is rare. The same applies to usefulness. Being useful isn't about being busy all the time; it's about working on things that matter.</p>
      <p>Being a "Contrarian Fool" means resisting the urge to chase the latest trend and instead focusing on the deeper, more meaningful work that provides lasting value. Whether it's in investing, business, or personal growth, the goal isn't to impress others with knowledge but to genuinely help them make better decisions.</p>
      <h3 style="color:#888; margin-top:2.5rem;">How to Be More Useful</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Solve Real Problems.</strong> Whether in work, business, or life, the best way to be useful is to solve problems that matter. If you're an investor, focus on long-term financial security rather than hype. If you're in business, build something that makes people's lives easier.</li>
        <li><strong>Share Knowledge Freely.</strong> We live in a world where valuable information is often hidden behind paywalls or sold as a get-rich-quick scheme. But real usefulness comes from making knowledge accessible. If you know something that could help someone, share it.</li>
        <li><strong>Think Long-Term.</strong> Many things that create real value—whether in investing, career, or personal development—take time. Avoid the temptation to chase short-term gains at the expense of lasting impact.</li>
        <li><strong>Be Honest & Transparent.</strong> In finance, as in life, a lot of people try to sell illusions. But usefulness is rooted in honesty. Being straightforward, even when the truth is hard to hear, is one of the most valuable things you can offer.</li>
        <li><strong>Help People Without Expecting Immediate Returns.</strong> The most useful people don't keep score. Whether mentoring someone, offering financial advice, or simply lending a hand, the best kind of usefulness comes from genuinely wanting to help, not from seeking something in return.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3 style="color:#888; margin-top:2.5rem;">Final Thoughts: The True Reward of Being Useful</h3>
      <p>Elon Musk's advice to "be useful" is deceptively simple but deeply powerful. When we shift our focus from personal gain to real value creation, everything changes. Success, influence, and even financial rewards tend to follow those who prioritize making a difference over just making money.</p>
      <p>For me, investing isn't just about numbers and returns—it's about helping people make better choices, avoid common pitfalls, and build wealth that lasts. That, to me, is how I can be most useful.</p>
      <p><strong>So here's my question for you:</strong> How can you be more useful today? Whether in your work, your relationships, or your long-term goals, what's one thing you can do to provide real value to someone else?</p>
      <p>Because in the end, the people who make the biggest impact—the ones who are remembered, respected, and truly successful—aren't the ones who take the most. They're the ones who give the most.</p>
