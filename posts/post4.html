    <h1>We are Business Owners</h1>
    <p class="post-subtitle"><em>When you truly understand what "buying a stock means buying a business" entails, investing stops being a guessing game and becomes a journey of growing alongside great companies.</em></p>

    <hr />

    <h2>1. The Most Overlooked Common Sense</h2>
    <p>
      One of Duan Yongping's most frequently repeated lines is simple: <strong>"Buying stocks means buying a company."</strong> It sounds so obvious that many investors assume they already understand it — but very few actually invest that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most people think about whether a stock will go up when they buy it, and how much profit they've made when they sell. To them, a stock is merely a trading symbol, not a real business that produces, competes, and grows every day.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "When I buy a stock, I never think of it as buying a piece of paper. I think of it as buying a business I'd be happy to own in its entirety." — Warren Buffett
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Buffett often tells shareholders: if you wouldn't buy the whole company at the current price, you probably shouldn't buy a single share. If you don't know what the business does, how it makes money, and whether it can keep doing so, you're not investing — you're speculating.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Imagine You Were Buying a Restaurant</h2>
    <p>
      The best analogy is buying a restaurant. If you were to acquire one, you'd study its location, foot traffic, reputation, menu, profitability, and prospects. You'd ask: "Will this restaurant still be making money five years from now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      You wouldn't buy shares just because a competitor's valuation went up, nor would you sell just because business was slow today. You know you're buying more than a price — you're buying a <em>money-making machine</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stocks are no different. They represent ownership. Buying a share means becoming a partner. You're entitled to the company's profit growth, cash flow, brand equity, and long-term value.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "A true investor thinks like an owner. Once you own part of a company, you're in the same boat with it — not guessing from the shore whether it will sail." — Li Lu
    </blockquote>

    <h2>3. Price Is the Shadow, Value Is the Substance</h2>
    <p>
      In the short term, stock prices move like the wind — shaped by news, sentiment, and macro events. But over the long term, <strong>price is merely the shadow of a company's value</strong>. Eventually, the shadow must align with the substance.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a company's competitive position is strengthening, profits are growing, and its moat is deepening, then even if the stock price dips, it will eventually reflect that reality. If the fundamentals are deteriorating, no chart pattern will save it.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "In the short run, the market is a voting machine; in the long run, it is a weighing machine." — Benjamin Graham
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The takeaway: the outcome of your investments ultimately depends on the quality of the underlying business, not the movements of its stock price.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Investing Is About Growing With Great Businesses</h2>
    <p>
      As Duan Yongping likes to say, "If you don't know what you're buying, don't buy it." Investing isn't about predicting prices; it's about understanding <strong>value, direction, and competitive advantage</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you'd be happy to own the entire company for the next decade, you should feel comfortable owning a small part of it, too. If you trust its management, understand its business model, and believe in its long-term value, short-term volatility becomes irrelevant.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "The essence of value investing is to allocate capital to places that can continue creating value." — Li Lu
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      When you truly internalize the idea that <strong>buying stocks means buying companies</strong>, investing ceases to be a numbers game. It becomes a partnership — one where you grow alongside businesses, letting time and compounding work for you.
    </p>

    <hr />
    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Look at stocks as partial ownership in real companies, and you'll start caring about their products, customers, moats, and future — not just the ticker on the screen. You're not buying a bet; you're buying a business. And when you do that, price noise fades away, leaving only time and the quiet power of compounding.</p>
