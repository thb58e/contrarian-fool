    <h1>The Utility Curve: Why I'm Starting This Blog</h1>
    <p><em>Not for fame. Not for clicks. Just to be genuinely helpful—a blog about money, wealth, life, and long-term investing, grounded in usefulness.</em></p>

    <h2>1. The Line That Hit Me Hard</h2>
    <p>There's this idea Elon Musk comes back to time and again—across interviews, talks, and off-the-cuff remarks—and it really stuck with me:</p>
    <p><strong>Be useful.</strong></p>
    <p>Not famous. Not impressive. Just... useful.</p>
    <p>He's said many times that he never set out to build something "great." He just wanted to build something useful. And over the years, that simple mindset became his compass. Whether it's electric cars, rockets, social media, or AI, his guiding question is:</p>
    <blockquote>"Is this useful to humanity?"</blockquote>
    <p>He once described real work using a kind of physics analogy (and as a former aerospace engineer, I loved this):</p>
    <blockquote>"The area under the curve of total utility is: how useful have you been × how many people you've helped."</blockquote>
    <p>The more useful you are, to more people, over time—the more meaningful your work becomes. It's a beautifully simple idea. And like most meaningful things, it's also really hard.</p>
    <p>But it's worth striving for.</p>

    <h2>2. Why I'm Starting This Blog</h2>
    <p>That idea hit me like a quiet thunderbolt. It made me stop and ask:</p>
    <blockquote>What am I doing that's actually useful? What's the area under my own utility curve?</blockquote>
    <p>In my day job, I try my best to support the people around me, hoping my work has been helpful and useful for the business, for my colleagues, ultimately for our clients. Meanwhile, investing has always been a deep passion of mine—something I genuinely love and want to spend the rest of my short life learning and doing.</p>
    <p>So here I am, starting this blog.</p>
    <p>Not because I have all the answers. Not because I've cracked some secret code. But because a small voice inside me keeps saying: <em>Maybe this could be useful for more people out there. Even just maybe one more person.</em></p>
    <p>And if writing here creates even a tiny bump on someone's utility curve—well, that feels like a good place to start.</p>

    <h2>3. Why Usefulness Matters</h2>
    <p>Let's take a step back.</p>
    <p>I've been thinking a lot about this idea of usefulness—not just in investing, but in life.</p>
    <p>If you look around, the people we genuinely admire tend to have something in common: <strong>they make things better for others</strong>. Often quietly, sometimes dramatically, but always in a real and tangible way.</p>
    <p>I think of my favourite teachers growing up. The ones who made you feel seen. Who explained things clearly, believed in you when you didn't believe in yourself, and didn't give up on you when you struggled. That's real usefulness.</p>
    <p>Or doctors and nurses. People who spend their days—and often nights—helping others heal. They're not doing it for status. They do it because someone has to. And that matters.</p>
    <p>Even in business, the most impactful startups didn't start with a pitch deck and a dream of becoming unicorns. They started by asking:</p>
    <blockquote>What's broken? How can I help fix it?</blockquote>
    <p>Stripe made online payments simple. Google made knowledge accessible. Amazon made shopping easier. ChatGPT (yes, hello) made knowledge more conversational. SpaceX might one day take us to Mars. That's usefulness at scale. And they deserve the value they've created.</p>
    <p>And if you look at politics and leadership, the ones who leave a legacy aren't the loudest or the most charismatic. They're the ones who showed up, did the hard work, and quietly made life better. Think of someone like Lee Kuan Yew. He didn't just change Singapore—he built it. That's usefulness, distilled.</p>
    <p>So… what about investing?</p>
    <p>It might not seem obvious at first, but I truly believe that investing can be a deeply useful craft.</p>
    <p>Think of Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger. Sure, they built immense wealth—but they also spent decades sharing their wisdom freely. Their letters, interviews, and offhand comments have helped millions of people (myself included) think more clearly and act more patiently.</p>
    <p>While clearly understanding how small I am, maybe—just maybe—through this blog, I can also pass on some of what I've seen and learned in finance.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If I can help someone avoid a dodgy product…</li>
      <li>Or give a friend the confidence to stay calm during a market panic…</li>
      <li>Or encourage one person to zoom out, think long-term, and invest more thoughtfully…</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That feels useful to me.</p>

    <h2>4. What I Plan to Share Here</h2>
    <p>So, what can you expect from this blog?</p>
    <p>Think of it as part notebook, part guide, part quiet companion. Here's what I'll be writing about:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lessons from my own investing journey—wins, losses, and the in-betweens</li>
      <li>Observations from inside the financial services world (spoiler: lots of parasites)</li>
      <li>Insights from legends like Buffett, Munger, Li Lu, Chris Hohn, and others</li>
      <li>Thoughts on long-term thinking, business models, mental models, and human nature</li>
      <li>And the occasional "here's what I've been wrestling with lately" post</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No hype. No shortcuts. No get-rich-quick nonsense. Just reflections and ideas I hope are genuinely useful for your investment journey.</p>

    <h2>5. How I Hope to Be Useful</h2>
    <p>This blog isn't a business. There's nothing for sale here. It's just me, sharing what I believe, what I know—and being honest about what I don't.</p>
    <p>If anything I write helps someone…</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid a painful investing mistake</li>
      <li>Make a slightly better decision</li>
      <li>Protect and build their wealth with a little more patience and peace of mind</li>
    </ul>
    <p>…then that's enough.</p>
    <p>And if writing all this helps me think more clearly along the way? That's a win too.</p>
    <p>Your feedback, thoughts, or questions are always welcome. That's part of the usefulness loop, after all.</p>

    <h2>6. A Final Thought</h2>
    <p>If you've read this far—thank you. In the world of full of news and social media, spending 5–6 minutes reading someone else writing, you're probably thoughtful, a bit contrarian, and not interested in chasing whatever's trending. You're exactly who I'm writing for.</p>
    <p>This blog won't be for everyone. And that's fine.</p>
    <p>But if any part of this resonates—if you've ever looked around at the financial world and thought, "There must be a better, calmer, saner way to do this"—then I hope you'll stick around.</p>
    <blockquote>"The area under the curve of total utility is: how useful have you been to your fellow human beings × how many people." – Elon Musk</blockquote>
    <p>Let's try to tilt that curve upward—for as long as we can, together.</p>
