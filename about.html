      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        I've been investing professionally for over a decade. What keeps me going is a deep love for the craft of long-term investing—and a strong belief in the timeless principles of <strong>Warren Buffett</strong> and <strong>Charlie Munger</strong>. I also draw inspiration from a few modern-day investors I admire deeply: <strong>Li Lu</strong> at Himalaya, <strong>Chris Hohn</strong> at TCI, and <strong>Duan Yongping</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        People often ask, "What stock should I buy?" But I think that's the wrong question. A better one is: <strong>Which business should I own?</strong> That shift—from stock picker to business owner—makes a world of difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started this blog to collect my thoughts: lessons learned, mistakes made, and ideas I'm still wrestling with. By sharing these reflections, I hope to be useful to others making investment decisions—especially those focused on preserving and growing their hard-earned wealth across generations. The kind of decisions I'd want my own family to make.
      </p>
      <p>
        To me, investing should be <strong>simple—but never easy</strong>. It's about deeply understanding the businesses you own, having the patience to let them grow, staying true to your values, and tuning out the noise of short-term thinking or chasing quick wins. <em>Easier said than done.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, great investing means finding the right business at the right price. But just as important—perhaps even harder—is <strong>avoiding the mistakes that can set you back years</strong>. I focus on owning high-quality businesses with durable growth potential and try to ignore the market's daily distractions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, I believe in <strong>owning great businesses</strong>—not chasing stock tickers.
      </p>
      <h2>A few reminders I live by:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Only invest in what I understand.</strong></li>
        <li>Buying stocks means buying ownership in real businesses. No more, no less.</li>
        <li>Do the right things for the long term.</li>
        <li>Invert: avoid what can hurt you.</li>
        <li>Fast is slow. Slow can be fastest.</li>
        <li>Stay rational. Ignore the sirens of short-term thinking.</li>
        <li>Be patient. Always.</li>
        <li>Fix mistakes quickly—however painful it feels now, it's the cheapest price you'll pay.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This blog is a place to share thoughts, principles, and perspectives—not investment recommendations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks for visiting. If you believe in long-term thinking, business fundamentals, durable wealth, and lifelong learning—<strong>welcome</strong>. You might be in good company.
