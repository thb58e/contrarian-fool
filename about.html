    <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 1rem;">About Me</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6;">
      Driven by a deep love for the craft of value investing, I embrace and devote myself to the timeless principles of Ben Graham, Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, Li Lu, and Duan Yongping. I believe in owning great businesses for the long term—not picking stock tickers.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 1rem;">
      Every day, I remind myself:
    </p>
    <ul style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6; padding-left: 20px; margin-top: 1rem;">
      <li><strong>Do the right things for the long term.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Invert—avoid the wrong things that can harm the long term.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Fast is slow; slow can be fastest.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Stay rational. Ignore shortsighted sirens.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Be patient. Always.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Fix mistakes quickly. However costly it seems now, it's the cheapest price you'll pay.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 1rem;">
      I share my perspectives, not investment recommendations. The value of investments and the income from them may fall as well as rise.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 1rem;">
      Thanks for stopping by. If you believe in long-term thinking, business fundamentals, durable wealth, and continuous learning—welcome. You mihgt be in good company.

    <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Investment Philosophy</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
      <em>Invest in what you understand, stay disciplined, think long term, and let great businesses compound quietly.</em>
    </p>
    <ol style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; padding-left: 1.2em;">
      <li style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;"><strong>Buy Businesses, Not Stocks</strong><br>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #555;">View stocks as partial ownership of real businesses.</span><br>
        Focus on long-term intrinsic value, not short-term price movements.<br>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #888;">"Buying a stock is buying the company's discounted future cash flows."</span>
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;"><strong>Stay Within Your Circle of Competence</strong><br>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #555;">Only invest in companies you deeply understand.</span><br>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #888;">"If you don't understand it, don't touch it."</span><br>
        Avoid complexity and hype — simplicity is strength.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;"><strong>Do the Right Thing + Do Things Right ("Benfen")</strong><br>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #555;">This is my core principle:</span><br>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #888;">"Do the right thing" = act ethically, invest in great businesses.<br>
        "Do things right" = execute patiently and carefully.</span><br>
        Success comes from discipline, integrity, and self-awareness, not shortcuts.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;"><strong>Long-Term Thinking Over Short-Term Gains</strong><br>
        Avoid trying to make fast money — that mindset leads to mistakes.<br>
        Great companies take time to show results.<br>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #888;">"Many people are poor because they want to get rich quickly."</span>
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;"><strong>Focus on Moats (Durable Competitive Advantages)</strong><br>
        Invest in companies with pricing power, strong brands, or network effects.<br>
        Businesses that can raise prices and still retain customers are likely to have a wide moat.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;"><strong>Be Price Sensitive, But Not Obsessive</strong><br>
        A great business at a fair price is better than a mediocre business at a low price.<br>
        Avoid market timing; instead, wait patiently for the right price to buy.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;"><strong>Rationality Over Emotion</strong><br>
        Stay calm during volatility. Don't get swayed by market euphoria or fear.<br>
        Check and revisit your investment thesis instead of reacting impulsively.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;"><strong>Invest with High Conviction</strong><br>
        Concentrated bets are fine — if you're within your competence zone.<br>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #888;">"Put all your eggs in one basket — and watch that basket closely."</span>
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;"><strong>Avoid Overtrading</strong><br>
        Frequent buying and selling leads to poor decisions and higher costs.<br>
        Hold great businesses for the long run.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;"><strong>Keep Learning & Reflecting</strong><br>
        Be humble. Review and learn from your mistakes.<br>
        Continuously refine your understanding of businesses, economics, and human nature.
      </li>
