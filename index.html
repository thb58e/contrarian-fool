      <h2 class="section-title">About</h2>
      <p>
        I've been investing professionally for over a decade. What keeps me going is a deep love for the craft of <em>long-term investing</em>‚Äîand a strong belief in the timeless principles of <strong>Warren Buffett</strong> and <strong>Charlie Munger</strong>. I also draw inspiration from a few modern-day investors I admire deeply: <strong>Li Lu</strong> at Himalaya, <strong>Chris Hohn</strong> at TCI, and <strong>Duan Yongping</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        People often ask, "What stock should I buy?" But I think that's the <em>wrong question</em>. A better one is: <strong>Which business should I own?</strong> That shift‚Äîfrom stock picker to business owner‚Äîmakes a world of difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started this blog to collect my thoughts: lessons learned, mistakes made, and ideas I'm still wrestling with. By sharing these reflections, I hope to be useful to others making investment decisions‚Äîespecially those focused on <strong>preserving and growing their hard-earned wealth across generations</strong>. The kind of decisions I'd want my own family to make.
      </p>
      <p>
        To me, investing should be <strong>simple‚Äîbut never easy</strong>. It's about deeply understanding the businesses you own, having the patience to let them grow, staying true to your values, and tuning out the noise of short-term thinking or chasing quick wins. <em>Easier said than done.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, great investing means finding the right business at the right price. But just as important‚Äîperhaps even harder‚Äîis <strong>avoiding the mistakes that can set you back years</strong>. I focus on owning high-quality businesses with durable growth potential and try to ignore the market's daily distractions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, I believe in <strong>owning great businesses</strong>‚Äînot chasing stock tickers.
      </p>
      <h2 style="font-size: 1.8em; margin-top: 2em;">A few reminders I live by:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Only invest in what I understand.</strong></li>
        <li>Buying stocks means <strong>buying ownership in real businesses</strong>. No more, no less.</li>
        <li><strong>Do the right things</strong> for the long term.</li>
        <li><strong>Invert:</strong> avoid what can hurt you.</li>
        <li><em>Fast is slow. Slow can be fastest.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Stay rational.</strong> Ignore the sirens of short-term thinking.</li>
        <li><strong>Be patient.</strong> <em>Always.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Fix mistakes quickly</strong>‚Äîhowever painful it feels now, <em>it's the cheapest price you'll pay.</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This blog is a place to share thoughts, principles, and perspectives‚Äî<em>not investment recommendations</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks for visiting. If you believe in long-term thinking, business fundamentals, durable wealth, and lifelong learning‚Äî<strong>welcome</strong>. <em>You might be in good company.</em>

        <h2 class="section-title">Investment Philosophy</h2>
        <blockquote>Buying a stock is buying a piece of a business. <em>Nothing more, nothing less.</em></blockquote>
        <p>
            When stock ownership is viewed as business ownership‚Äîwith the intention to hold for many years‚Äîimportant questions naturally arise:
        </p>
    
        <h3>‚ùØ Circle of Competence</h3>
        <p>
            Can the business be clearly understood? <strong>If not, it should be avoided.</strong>
        </p>
    
        <h3>‚ùØ Business Model &amp; Moat</h3>
        <p>
            How does the company make money? Who are the customers? How long can those earnings last?
            <br>The strongest businesses:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Earn <strong>durable cash flows</strong> across market cycles</li>
            <li>Deliver <strong>genuine value</strong> to users</li>
            <li>Rely on <strong>simple, understandable models</strong>‚Äînot financial complexity</li>
            <li>Encourage repeat purchases through <em>habit, satisfaction, or necessity</em></li>
            <li>Enjoy high <strong>customer loyalty and pricing power</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The goal is to find businesses that can become <em>"friends of time,"</em> compounding quietly over the years.
        </p>
    
        <h3>‚ùØ Management &amp; Culture</h3>
        <p>
            Is the founder a long-term thinker with sincerity and vision?
            <br>Important considerations include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A culture focused on <strong>user value, not shortcuts</strong></li>
            <li>Systems that <strong>respect human nature</strong> and empower employees</li>
            <li>A leadership team that aligns incentives with <strong>long-term results</strong></li>
            <li>High employee retention, intrinsic motivation, and a <strong>shared sense of purpose</strong></li>
            <li>An organization capable of <strong>doing the right thing even when it's hard</strong></li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>‚ùØ Margin of Safety</h3>
        <p>
            What is the business worth?
            <br><strong>Avoid overpaying.</strong> Price matters‚Äîespecially when future cash flows are being bought with today's capital.
        </p>
