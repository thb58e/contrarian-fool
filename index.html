      <h2 class="section-title">About</h2>
      <p>
        I've been investing professionally for over a decade. What keeps me going is a deep love for the craft of long-term investing—and a strong belief in the timeless principles of <strong>Warren Buffett</strong> and <strong>Charlie Munger</strong>. I also draw inspiration from a few modern-day investors I admire deeply: <strong>Li Lu</strong> at Himalaya, <strong>Chris Hohn</strong> at TCI, and <strong>Duan Yongping</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        People often ask, "What stock should I buy?" But I think that's the wrong question. A better one is: <strong>Which business should I own?</strong> That shift—from stock picker to business owner—makes a world of difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started this blog to collect my thoughts: lessons learned, mistakes made, and ideas I'm still wrestling with. By sharing these reflections, I hope to be useful to others making investment decisions—especially those focused on preserving and growing their hard-earned wealth across generations. The kind of decisions I'd want my own family to make.
      </p>
      <p>
        To me, investing should be <strong>simple—but never easy</strong>. It's about deeply understanding the businesses you own, having the patience to let them grow, staying true to your values, and tuning out the noise of short-term thinking or chasing quick wins. <em>Easier said than done.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, great investing means finding the right business at the right price. But just as important—perhaps even harder—is <strong>avoiding the mistakes that can set you back years</strong>. I focus on owning high-quality businesses with durable growth potential and try to ignore the market's daily distractions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, I believe in <strong>owning great businesses</strong>—not chasing stock tickers.
      </p>
      <h2>A few reminders I live by:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Only invest in what I understand.</strong></li>
        <li>Buying stocks means buying ownership in real businesses. No more, no less.</li>
        <li>Do the right things for the long term.</li>
        <li>Invert: avoid what can hurt you.</li>
        <li>Fast is slow. Slow can be fastest.</li>
        <li>Stay rational. Ignore the sirens of short-term thinking.</li>
        <li>Be patient. Always.</li>
        <li>Fix mistakes quickly—however painful it feels now, it's the cheapest price you'll pay.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This blog is a place to share thoughts, principles, and perspectives—not investment recommendations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks for visiting. If you believe in long-term thinking, business fundamentals, durable wealth, and lifelong learning—<strong>welcome</strong>. You might be in good company.

    <section id="philosophy" style="max-width: 700px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 2rem;">
        <h2 class="section-title">Investment Philosophy</h2>
        <ol style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; padding-left: 1.2em;">
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;"><strong>Buy Businesses, Not Stocks</strong><br>
            <span style="font-style: italic; color: #555;">View stocks as partial ownership of real businesses.</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Buying a stock is buying a piece of a business. Nothing more, nothing less.</span><br>
            <span style="font-style: italic; color: #888;">"Buying a stock is buying the company's discounted future cash flows."</span>
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;"><strong>Stay Within Your Circle of Competence</strong><br>
            <span style="font-style: italic; color: #555;">Only invest in companies you deeply understand.</span><br>
            <span style="font-style: italic; color: #888;">"If you don't understand it, don't touch it."</span><br>
            Avoid complexity and hype — simplicity is strength.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;"><strong>Do the Right Thing + Do Things Right ("Benfen")</strong><br>
            <span style="font-style: italic; color: #555;">This is my core principle:</span><br>
            <span style="font-style: italic; color: #888;">"Do the right thing" = act ethically, invest in great businesses.<br>
            "Do things right" = execute patiently and carefully.</span><br>
            Success comes from discipline, integrity, and self-awareness, not shortcuts.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;"><strong>Long-Term Thinking Over Short-Term Gains</strong><br>
            Avoid trying to make fast money — that mindset leads to mistakes.<br>
            Great companies take time to show results.<br>
            <span style="font-style: italic; color: #888;">"Many people are poor because they want to get rich quickly."</span>
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;"><strong>Focus on Moats (Durable Competitive Advantages)</strong><br>
            Invest in companies with pricing power, strong brands, or network effects.<br>
            Businesses that can raise prices and still retain customers are likely to have a wide moat.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;"><strong>Be Price Sensitive, But Not Obsessive</strong><br>
            A great business at a fair price is better than a mediocre business at a low price.<br>
            Avoid market timing; instead, wait patiently for the right price to buy.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;"><strong>Rationality Over Emotion</strong><br>
            Stay calm during volatility. Don't get swayed by market euphoria or fear.<br>
            Check and revisit your investment thesis instead of reacting impulsively.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;"><strong>Invest with High Conviction</strong><br>
            Concentrated bets are fine — if you're within your competence zone.<br>
            <span style="font-style: italic; color: #888;">"Put all your eggs in one basket — and watch that basket closely."</span>
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;"><strong>Avoid Overtrading</strong><br>
            Frequent buying and selling leads to poor decisions and higher costs.<br>
            Hold great businesses for the long run.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 1.2em;"><strong>Keep Learning & Reflecting</strong><br>
            Be humble. Review and learn from your mistakes.<br>
            Continuously refine your understanding of businesses, economics, and human nature.
          </li>
