    <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 1rem;">About Me</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6;">
      With deep love of investing and independence, I am an investor with over 10 years of experience in the professional investment world, but at heart, I've always seen myself as a long-term business owner.
      I started this blog to help people make thoughtful, patient investment decisions—just like I would for my own family.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 1rem;">
      I believe that investing should be simple, grounded in understanding, and always done with integrity. I focus on high-quality businesses that can grow over time,
      and I avoid short-term noise. My goal is to help people build durable generational wealth—not through speculation, but through ownership of great businesses with discipline, wisdom, and doing the right thing,
      quietly and consistently.
