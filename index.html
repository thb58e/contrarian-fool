    <h2>Welcome to Contrarian Fool</h2>
    <p>I'm an investor with over 10 years of experience in the professional investment world, but at heart, I have always seen myself as a long-term business owner, not a stock picker. I started this site to help people make thoughtful, patient investment decisions—just like I would for my own family. I believe that investing should be simple, grounded in understanding, and always done with integrity. I focus on high-quality businesses that can grow over time, and I avoid short-term noise. My goal is to help clients build durable wealth—not through speculation, but through discipline, rationality, and doing the right thing, quietly and consistently.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Investment Philosophy</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6;">
      Investment philosophy: Invest in what you understand, stay disciplined, think long term, and let great businesses compound quietly. Key principles:
    </p>
    <ul style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6;">
      <li><strong>1. Buy Businesses, Not Stocks</strong><br>
        View stocks as partial ownership of real businesses.<br>
        Focus on long-term intrinsic value, not short-term price movements.<br>
        "Buying a stock is buying the company's discounted future cash flows."
      </li>
      <li><strong>2. Stay Within Your Circle of Competence</strong><br>
        Only invest in companies you deeply understand.<br>
        "If you don't understand it, don't touch it."<br>
        Avoid complexity and hype — simplicity is strength.
      </li>
      <li><strong>3. Do the Right Thing + Do Things Right ("Benfen")</strong><br>
        This is his core principle:<br>
        "Do the right thing" = act ethically, invest in great businesses.<br>
        "Do things right" = execute patiently and carefully.<br>
        Success comes from discipline, integrity, and self-awareness, not shortcuts.
      </li>
      <li><strong>4. Long-Term Thinking Over Short-Term Gains</strong><br>
        Avoid trying to make fast money — that mindset leads to mistakes.<br>
        Great companies take time to show results.<br>
        "Many people are poor because they want to get rich quickly."
      </li>
      <li><strong>5. Focus on Moats (Durable Competitive Advantages)</strong><br>
        Invest in companies with pricing power, strong brands, or network effects.<br>
        Businesses that can raise prices and still retain customers are likely to have a wide moat.
      </li>
      <li><strong>6. Be Price Sensitive, But Not Obsessive</strong><br>
        A great business at a fair price is better than a mediocre business at a low price.<br>
        Avoid market timing; instead, wait patiently for the right price to buy.
      </li>
      <li><strong>7. Rationality Over Emotion</strong><br>
        Stay calm during volatility. Don't get swayed by market euphoria or fear.<br>
        Check and revisit your investment thesis instead of reacting impulsively.
      </li>
      <li><strong>8. Invest with High Conviction</strong><br>
        Concentrated bets are fine — if you're within your competence zone.<br>
        "Put all your eggs in one basket — and watch that basket closely."
      </li>
      <li><strong>9. Avoid Overtrading</strong><br>
        Frequent buying and selling leads to poor decisions and higher costs.<br>
        Hold great businesses for the long run.
      </li>
      <li><strong>10. Keep Learning & Reflecting</strong><br>
        Be humble. Review and learn from your mistakes.<br>
        Continuously refine your understanding of businesses, economics, and human nature.
      </li>
    </ul>
